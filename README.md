My solutions for the "advent of code" challenge of 2019.
===

For each day, there is a binary which outputs the answers to parts 1 and 2 of the question.
Each binary asserts that it is producing the correct answer.

To run a specific day (e.g day 5), use
```
cargo run --release -p 05
```

To run all days at once, use
```
cargo run --release
```

To run all unit tests, use
```
cargo test --release --workspace
```
